## Code block

As developers we make applications for people, and as developers are people too sometimes we 
build technical applications. 

Sharing code should also be for everyone and the `Tenon-UI CodeBlock` helps you achieve that by
giving you an easy to use, accessible highlighted code block.

This component leverages [react-syntax-highligher](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter)
and styles the code with [Prism syntax highlighter](https://prismjs.com/). However some tweaks
have been made to ensure that all text has sufficient colour contrast to be readable by as many
people as possible.

**NOTE**: Every single code example in this documentation site uses the `CodeBlock` component!

### Installation

Due to the payload size of a syntax highlighting, this component is not part of the main
`Tenon-UI` package. 

#### Installing with npm

```
npm install @tenon-io/tenon-codeblock
```

#### Installing with yarn

```
yarn add @tenon-io/tenon-codeblock
```

### Usage

The code block can either display the contents of a file or a code string, making it highly 
flexible.

#### With a file

```
//... 

import CodeBlock from '@tenon-io/tenon-codeblock';

//...

<CodeBlock
    file="/codeExample.js"
/>
```

The `CodeBlock` component comes with built-in `XHR`, so it will fetch the code file automatically
from the server at the given location and display it.

This could be handy if you are displaying actual code files, as the code blocks will then update
real time.

#### With a code string

```
//... 

import CodeBlock from '@tenon-io/tenon-codeblock';

//...

<CodeBlock
    codeString={codeText}
    onReset={() => {
        console.log('reset');
    }}
/>
```

### Accessibility features

The `CodeBlock` component enables easy keyboard navigation of the blocks themselves. The blocks
themselves are in the focus order of the HTML so the snippets can easily be selected with the `TAB`
key.

Using standard text selecting key combinations you are also able to change the exact code selection.

And finally, you also get text selection help when clicking on the code block with your mouse.

A side effect of this is that you can edit the text in the code block, but the original text of the
code block is reset when the code block loses focus.

### Componentn props

#### file
The url of the code file you would like to display in the code block.

#### codeString
A formatted code string you would like to display in the code block.

#### onReset
An event handler that gets called if the user changes the code and the code is subsequently
reset `onBlur`.

This even is **NOT** called if no changes are made in the text.

With this even you could inform your users that the text has been reset for the sake of clarity:

```
<CodeBlock
    file="codeExample.js"
    onReset={() => {
        // Notify the user that any changes made to the text has been reset.
    }}
/>
```

#### language
In order to keep the bundle size small, the most common languages supported in a React 
application is supported. They are:

1. **jsx**
2. **javascript**
3. **json**
4. **html**

By default the code block is setup to render `JSX` code but you can specify the language with the
`language` prop:

```
<CodeBlock
    file="codeExample.js"
    language="json"
/>
```

If you would like to use this code block with another language format, please let us know!
