import Helmet from "react-helmet";

import Layout from '../components/Layout';

export default ({children}) => 
<Layout>
    <Helmet>
        <title>Tenon-ui | Smart form required knowledge</title>
    </Helmet>{children}
</Layout>

## Smart form required knowledge

Depending on how much of the functionality you use, you may be confronted with some advanced
React concepts.

### Child render props

Using the standard `props.children` prop as a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render)
is used prolifically in the forms components.

Example:
```
import React from 'react';
import { Form } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';
import { someSaveFunction } from './my-data-layer';

class FormClass extends React.Component {
    onSubmitHandler = formData => {
        someSaveFunction(formData);
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <Form onSubmit={this.onSubmitHandler}>
                {({ formControls, validity, hasSubmitted }) => {
                    //Your form content...
                }}
            </Form>
        );
    }
}
```

### Prop getter functions

`Tenon-ui` allows you to implement your own view components while still making use
of the data and accessibility engine provided.

Whereas we would like you to use our view components, as they will ensure accessibility
of the components themselves, we also understand that UI component libraries are 
often too restrictive and not every application and design you may need to code can be solved 
with the same static views.

`Tenon-ui` exposes its data and accessibility engine through `prop getter functions` injected 
into render functions via `children render props`.
 
These functions allow you, not only to access the prop needed to drive your views, but also to 
override and enrich the standard set of props given:

```
<Form.TextInputController name="petName">
    {({ getLabelProps, getInputProps }) => (
        <div>
            <label {...getLabelProps()}>
                Enter your pet's name:
            </label>
            <input
                {...getInputProps({
                    className: 'some-class'
                })}
            />
        </div>
    )}
</Form.TextInputController>
```

The specifics around the `Tenon-ui` components will be discussed later, but if the way
this code snippet gives props to the `<label>` and `<input>` elements are not clear,
