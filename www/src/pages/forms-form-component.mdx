## The Form component
Instead of the standard JSX `<form>` element, use the `Form` component, imported from `Tenon.UI`.

This component employs a [children render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render)
to render the form view:

```
import React from 'react';
import { Form } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';
import { someSaveFunction } from './my-data-layer';

class FormClass extends React.Component {
    onSubmitHandler = formData => {
        someSaveFunction(formData);
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <Form onSubmit={this.onSubmitHandler}>
                {({ formControls, validity, hasSubmitted }) => {
                    //Your form content...
                }}
            </Form>
        );
    }
}
```

Every `Form` requires a render function supplied as children of the component. An `onSubmit`
handler is also required.

The `Form` component automatically manages all the child form element components (see below)
and will pass 

### Form props

#### children
This prop is required.

A render function accepting three paramaters:

##### formControls
A full summary object of all form controls on the page. This object is always up to date
with the latest values from the form controls.

The structure of this object is:

```json
{
    [controlName]: {
        controlId: [autogenerated unique guid value],
        value: [current field value]
        validity: [boolean value indicating field validity],
        errorText: [string error for invalid field, otherwise '']
    },
    ...repeated for all controls on form
}

```

##### validity
A boolean value indicating the combined validity values for each form control. For `Form`s where
all the controls pass validation the value will be `true`, if at least one control fails
validation the value will be `false`.

This flag can be used to trigger global error blocks, for example.

##### hasSubmitted 
A boolean value indicating if the user has triggered a `onSubmit` event at least once.

This can also be used to display information, such as error blocks, only after the user
has attempted to submit the `Form`.

#### onSubmit
This prop is required.

An event handler function that is called in a submit event occurs and all form controls
passes validation.

**NOTE**: This event is NOT called on a submit event if any of the form controls fails
validation. Please see `onRawSubmit` below if you need this functionality.

If the `Form` is valid, the event handler is called with a `submitData` object containing
the current, valid values for each control on the `Form`, by control name:

```json
{
    [controlName]: [current control value],
    ..repeated for each control rendered on the form
}
```
#### onRawSubmit
An optional event handler that gets triggered by every submit action on the `Form`, regardless
of the validity state of the `Form`.

This event handler gets called with a `formControls` and `validity` parameter that has the same
shape and function of those injected into the view by the `Form`'s children render prop.

This function can, for example, be used to set focus on a summary error block. 

#### formData 
An object used to pass data into the smart form, for instance when loading already saved data from 
the server.

This object shape mirrors that of the `submitData` object passed into the `onSubmit` handler.

```json
{
    [controlName]: [current control value],
    ..repeated for each control rendered on the form
}
```

**Note**: This object does **NOT** get mutated by the form. It is simply there to pass data into
the form. Every time this object is changed it will overwrite the form data. If the form data
is changed via user interaction, these changes will **NOT** be reflected in this prop.

#### alwaysShowErrors
By default, the smart form control are built to only display validation error conditions once
a submit has been attempted. As this is the user experience we recommend.

Should the need arise to immediately show errors real-time , this boolean flag can be set to 
`true`.

#### className
Allows setting a `className` on the actual rendered `<form>` element.
