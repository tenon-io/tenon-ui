## The Tenon-UI view components

<PageNav targets={
    ['Usage',
    'Common component props', 
    'The Input component', 
    'The Textarea component']
    } />

The `Tenon-UI` view components are accessible. We recommend using these view components if you
want to ensure that your form fields are accessible.

The section on [creating elemens](/forms-creating-elements) shows how to use the view components
in the render prop functions of the smart controllers.



- [The Input component](/forms-view-components/#the-input-component)
- [The Textarea component](/forms-view-components/#the-textarea-component)

### Usage 

All view components are used in a similar way. Inside the `children render prop` of the smart
controllers.

Here is an example of using the `Input` component to show how all view components can be 
used:

```
//...

{props => (
    <Input
        {...props}
        requiredText="( required )"
        labelText="Pet type"
    />
)}

//...
```

It is **VERY** important to spread the props object from the render function of the 
`controller` onto the `view component`. This passes the required props into 
our view components The same props you would otherwise use when creating your own views.

The reason for this syntax is that you can now also easily set the props of the view 
component. Note above how the `labelText` for this specific component was set.

### Common component props

#### labelText
Required when present. Not used for `RadioGroup` and `CheckboxGroup`;

Every form control needs a text label. With this prop you provide the text that will be rendered inside
the `<label>` element.

#### labelProps
Not used for `RadioGroup` and `CheckboxGroup`;

This is an optional object that can be used to override or enrich the props that passed to the 
`<label>` element.

For example, if you want to add a specific `className` to the `<label>` of the `<textarea>` element 
you can do this:

```
//...

{props => (
    <Textarea
        {...props}
        labelProps={{
            className: 'special-label-class'            
        }}
        labelText="Pet description"
    />
)}

//...

```

#### contentHintText
Every form control can also have `content hint text`. This is text that describes what should be
entered into the control. For example, an input that requires at least five characters.

**Special note**: The `<input> placeholder` attributes is often used for this, but this is **wrong**. The placeholder
should **never** be used for this function as it causes difficulty for many users out there.

Specify a content hint text as follows:

```
//..

{props => (
    <Input
        {...props}
        labelText="Pet name"
        contentHintText="The pet's name should be longer than three characters" 
    />
)}

//..
```

Content hints are rendered as follows:

<Form
    onSubmit={submitData => {
        alert(JSON.stringify(submitData));
    }}
>
    {({ formControls }) => (
    <>
        <Form.TextInputController
            name="petName"
            validators={[
                validator(
                    isLongerThan(3), 
                    'The name is too short'
                )
            ]}
        >
            {props => (
                <Input
                    {...props}
                    labelText="Pet name"
                    contentHintText="The name should be longer than 3 characters"
                />
            )}
        </Form.TextInputController>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </>   
    )}
</Form>

Should you open the browser's HTML inspector, you will find that the content hint container
is linked to the `<input>` element with the `aria-describedby` property. This is very important
for screen readers.

#### requiredText
With this prop you can set the text that displays next to the `<label>` text for required fields.

If you do not set this, a `*` will be shown for required fields as this is a standard pattern
on the web. If you use this, please put a legend somewhere on your form that indicates that a
`*` denotes a required field. 

You don't have to do any more than that as `Tenon-UI` already marks required fields in a way
that screen readers can interpret. 

#### Tenon-UI specific props

Should you look at the code for the view components, you will see that it also expects a number 
of other props. These are the props that is provided by the `smart controller components` as
seen in the examples above. 

Please do not provide these props yourself as this will most probably break the functionality of
the component.

#### Other props
Not relevant for `RadioGroup` and `CheckboxGroup`;

Any other props given to these components will be passed onto the relevant functional HTML element.

#### Refs
In some case you may want to create a [React ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)
to the form controls.

In accessible applications, this is mostly done in cases where you want to set focus to a specific 
element. 

Each view component [forward the ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) to the the correct element so that you can easily set focus
when required:

```
//...
this.inputRef = React.createRef();
//...
{props => (
    <Input
        {...props}
        labelText="Pet's age"
        ref={this.inputRef}
    />
)}
```

### The Input component

As already illustrated above, the input component is used as:
```
import { Form, Input, validator } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

//...

<Form.TextInputController
    name="petType"
    required="true"
    validators={[
        validator(
            isRequired,
            'A type of pet is required'
        )
    ]}
>
    {props => (
        <Input
            {...props}
            requiredText="( required )"
            labelText="Pet type"
        />
    )}
</Form.TextInputController>

//...
```

This codes renders as:

<Form
    onSubmit={submitData => {
        alert(JSON.stringify(submitData));
    }}
>
    {({ formControls }) => (
    <>
        <Form.TextInputController
            name="petType"
            required="true"
            validators={[
                validator(
                    isRequired,
                    'A type of pet is required'
                )
            ]}
        >
            {props => (
                <Input
                    {...props}
                    requiredText="( required )"
                    labelText="Pet type"
                />
            )}
        </Form.TextInputController>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </>   
    )}
</Form>

#### Overriding the input type
By default an `<input type="text">` will be rendered. But this can also be overridden.

The `TextInputController` will also play nice with other types.

Override it like this:
```
{props => (
    <Input
        {...props}
        labelText="Pet's age"
        type="number"
    />
)}
```

### The Textarea component

```
import { Form, Textarea, validator } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

//...

<Form.TextareaController
    name="petDescription"
    required="true"
    validators={[
        validator(
            isRequired,
            'A description of your pet is required'
        )
    ]}
>
    {props => (
        <Textarea
            {...props}
            requiredText="( required )"
            labelText="Pet description"
            rows="10"
        />
    )}
</Form.TextareaController>

//...
```

This will render the following:

<Form
    onSubmit={submitData => {
        alert(JSON.stringify(submitData));
    }}
>
    {({ formControls }) => (
    <>
        <Form.TextareaController
            name="petDescription"
            required="true"
            validators={[
                validator(isRequired, 'A description of your pet is required')
            ]}
        >
            {props => (
                <Textarea
                    {...props}
                    requiredText="( required )"
                    labelText="Pet description"
                    rows="10"
                />
            )}
        </Form.TextareaController>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </>   
    )}
</Form>
