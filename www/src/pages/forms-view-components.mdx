## The Tenon-UI view components

<PageNav targets={
    ['Usage',
    'Common component props', 
    'The Input component', 
    'The Textarea component']
    } />

The `Tenon-UI` view components are accessible. We recommend using these view components if you
want to ensure that your form fields are accessible.

The section on [creating elemens](/forms-creating-elements) shows how to use the view components
in the render prop functions of the smart controllers.



- [The Input component](/forms-view-components/#the-input-component)
- [The Textarea component](/forms-view-components/#the-textarea-component)

### Usage 

All view components can be used in one of two ways.

#### The component prop
Here is an example of using the `Input` component by using the `component` prop of the controller.

```
<Form.TextInputController
    name="petName"
    labelText="Name of pet"
    component={Input}
/>
```

Note that the `labelText` prop for the `view component` is added to the `controller component` which
will then pass these props through to the `view component`. This **ONLY** happens when 
you use the `component` prop.

This method is recommended when using a view component, even if you have created it yourself,
and will be used further on this page. 

#### The children render prop
You can still use the view components in the `children render prop` of the controllers.

Here is an example of using the `Input` component to show how all view components can be 
used inside the `children render prop` of each controller:

```
<Form.TextInputController
    name="petName"
    labelText="Name of pet"
    component={Input}
>
{props => (
    <Input
        {...props}
        labelText="Pet type"
    />
)}
</Form.TextInputController>
```

It is **VERY** important to spread the props object from the render function of the 
`controller` onto the `view component`. This passes the required props into 
our view components The same props you would otherwise use when creating your own views.

### Common component props

#### labelText
Required when present. Not used for `RadioGroup` and `CheckboxGroup`;

Every form control needs a text label. With this prop you provide the text that will be rendered inside
the `<label>` element.

#### labelProps
Not used for `RadioGroup` and `CheckboxGroup`;

This is an optional object that can be used to override or enrich the props that passed to the 
`<label>` element.

For example, if you want to add a specific `className` to the `<label>` of the `<textarea>` element 
you can do this:

```
<Form.TextareaController
    name="petDescription"
    labelText="Describe your pet"
    labelProps={{
        className: 'special-label-class'            
    }}
    component={Textarea}
/>
```

#### contentHintText
Every form control can also have `content hint text`. This is text that describes what should be
entered into the control. For example, an input that requires at least five characters.

**Special note**: The `<input> placeholder` attributes is often used for this, but this is **wrong**. The placeholder
should **never** be used for this function as it causes difficulty for many users out there.

Specify a content hint text as follows:

```
<Form.TextInputController
    name="petName"
    labelText="Name of pet"
    contentHintText="The pet's name should be longer than three characters" 
    component={Input}
/>
```

Content hints are rendered as follows:

<Form
    onSubmit={submitData => {
        alert(JSON.stringify(submitData));
    }}
>
    {({ formControls }) => (
    <>
        <Form.TextInputController
            name="petName"
            validators={[
                validator(
                    isLongerThan(3), 
                    'The name is too short'
                )
            ]}
            labelText="Pet name"
            contentHintText="The name should be longer than 3 characters"
            component={Input}                    
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </>   
    )}
</Form>

Should you open the browser's HTML inspector, you will find that the content hint container
is linked to the `<input>` element with the `aria-describedby` property. This is very important
for screen readers.

#### requiredText
With this prop you can set the text that displays next to the `<label>` text for required fields.

If you do not set this, a `*` will be shown for required fields as this is a standard pattern
on the web. If you use this, please put a legend somewhere on your form that indicates that a
`*` denotes a required field. 

You don't have to do any more than that as `Tenon-UI` already marks required fields in a way
that screen readers can interpret. 

#### Tenon-UI specific props

Should you look at the code for the view components, you will see that it also expects a number 
of other props. These are the props that is provided by the `smart controller components` as
seen in the examples above. 

Please do not provide these props yourself as this will most probably break the functionality of
the component.

#### Other props
Not relevant for `RadioGroup` and `CheckboxGroup`;

Any other props given to these components will be passed onto the relevant functional HTML element.

#### Refs
In some case you may want to create a [React ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)
to the form controls.

In accessible applications, this is mostly done in cases where you want to set focus to a specific 
element. 

Each view component [forward the ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) to the the correct element so that you can easily set focus
when required:

```
//...
this.inputRef = React.createRef();
//...
{props => (
    <Input
        {...props}
        labelText="Pet's age"
        ref={this.inputRef}
    />
)}
```

**Note**: If you want to create a `ref` to any of the view components, you **HAVE** to use
the `children render prop` version. Otherwise you will get a reference to the instance of 
the controller component class!

### The Input component

As already illustrated above, the input component is used as:
```
import { Form, Input, validator } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

//...

<Form.TextInputController
    name="petType"
    required="true"
    validators={[
        validator(
            isRequired,
            'A type of pet is required'
        )
    ]}
     requiredText="( required )"
     labelText="Pet type"
     componen={Input}           
/>

//...
```

This codes renders as:

<Form
    onSubmit={submitData => {
        alert(JSON.stringify(submitData));
    }}
>
    {({ formControls }) => (
    <>
        <Form.TextInputController
            name="petType"
            required="true"
            validators={[
                validator(
                    isRequired,
                    'A type of pet is required'
                )
            ]}
            requiredText="( required )"
            labelText="Pet type"
            component={Input}
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </>   
    )}
</Form>

#### Overriding the input type
By default an `<input type="text">` will be rendered. But this can also be overridden.

The `TextInputController` will also play nice with other types.

Override it like this:
```
<Form.TextInputController
    name="petAge"
    labelText="Age of pet"
    type="number"
    contentHintText="The pet's name should be longer than three characters" 
/>
```

### The Textarea component

```
import { Form, Textarea, validator } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

//...

<Form.TextareaController
    name="petDescription"
    required="true"
    validators={[
        validator(
            isRequired,
            'A description of your pet is required'
        )
    ]}
    requiredText="( required )"
    labelText="Pet description"
    rows="10"
    component={Textarea}
/>

//...
```

This will render the following:

<Form
    onSubmit={submitData => {
        alert(JSON.stringify(submitData));
    }}
>
    {({ formControls }) => (
    <>
        <Form.TextareaController
            name="petDescription"
            required="true"
            validators={[
                validator(isRequired, 'A description of your pet is required')
            ]}
            requiredText="( required )"
            labelText="Pet description"
            rows="10"
            component={Textarea}
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </>   
    )}
</Form>
