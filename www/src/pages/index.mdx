## Welcome to Tenon-UI

These are the documentation pages of `Tenon-UI`. Tenon's accessible React components library.

### Why another component library.

Tenon-UI strives to become a go-to library for React developers who want to build inclusive and
accessible sites that can be used by as many people as possible.

If you do not yet know why this is a very good idea or how this relates to React in general, 
please visit the [React Accessibility Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html).

### Use our views or bring your own.

Not every project calls for the same visual representation, and we appreciate that. So Tenon-UI has
been built with this in mind. 

All visual parts of the library is completely plug and play allowing your to implement your own
view if required. 

Tenon-UI also comes with its own separate `StyleSheet` and `SASS` source files so you can change
it or even replace it completely.

We want to make it as easy as possible for you to build powerful applications that are 
accessible with our components.

### Disclaimer

With great power comes great responsibility.

We have gone through a lot of effort to ensure that this library conforms to current 
accessibility requirements, working on as wide a range of browsers and assistive technologies
as possible.

With this in mind, the view components shipped with the library play a crucial 
role to ensure this feature.

If you do decide to replace our view components with your own, we can no longer ensure an
accessible result, so we do actually recommend that you just use our views.

If you still want to replace our view components, please read the documentation, and 
supporting linked information carefully first. Also have a look at how our view 
components are built and use them as a a guideline for your own.

### Enjoy  

Tenon-UI exists to make your life easier. Please enjoy the productivity boost these
components add.

### What about Hooks and Suspense?

We are fully aware of the future path of React. So we will invest time in the near future to also
bring support for `Hooks` and `Suspense` where appropriate. 

But first we want to provide you with component built on the current tried and tested patterns.

### Found a bug or want to help?
