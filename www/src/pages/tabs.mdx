import Helmet from 'react-helmet';

import Layout from '../components/Layout';
import Tabs from '../../../src/modules/tabs/Tabs';

export default ({ children }) => (
    <Layout>
        <Helmet>
            <title>Tenon-ui | Tabbed interface</title>
        </Helmet>
        {children}
    </Layout>
);

## Tabbed interface

Rendering accessible tabbed interfaces is not simple. There are a number of features that you
need to implement if you want all users to be able to easily interact with your tabs.

You can read more about this on [the W3C ARIA design patterns page for tabs](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel)
or [the tabbed interfaces page of the Inclusive Components website](https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/).

With `Tenon-UI` this become very easy as all the hard work has been done for you.

### Usage

The `Tabs` component is a compound component that also gives you access to the `Tabs.Tab` component.

```
import React from 'react';
import Tabs from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

const TabsExample = () => (
    <Tabs>
        <Tabs.Tab title="Panel 1">
            <p>You are on panel 1.</p>
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab title="Panel 2">
            <p>You are one panel 2.</p>
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab title="Panel 3">
            <p>You are on panel 3.</p>
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab title="Panel 4">
            <p>You are on panel 4.</p>
        </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>
);

export default TabsExample;
```

You then get:

<Tabs>
    <Tabs.Tab title="Panel 1">
        <p>You are on panel 1.</p>
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab title="Panel 2">
        <p>You are one panel 2.</p>
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab title="Panel 3">
        <p>You are on panel 3.</p>
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab title="Panel 4">
        <p>You are on panel 4.</p>
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You are free to render any view you'd like inside the tabs.

**Please note**: True tabs are not site navigation elements. If you are rendering large
views inside your tabs, rather consider doing it with routing and navigation elements. `Tenon-UI`
uses styles to hide and show the tabs, so rendering very large content in many tabs will
incur a performance hit.

### Tabs.Tab component props

#### title

This prop is required.

The title of the panel. This is the text that is rendered as the text inside the tabs. By default,
it is also rendered as heading of the tab panel.

#### noHeading

This boolean prop can be used if you do not want to render the `title` texts as a heading inside the
tab panel.

#### className

This prop is passed through to the wrapping `<section>` element of the tab panel.

#### headingLevel

The `Tabs` component makes use of the [Tenon-UI Heading component](/headings) to automatically
render the correct heading level.

If your application does not use this component you can override the default level by giving the
desired heading level in this prop.

```
<Tabs.Tab
    title="Panel 4"
    headingLevel="3">
    <p>You are on panel 4.</p>
</Tabs.Tab>
```

#### name

A string name prop that can be used to identify the tabs by name. This can be useful in the
toggle render function described next.

If no `name` prop is given the tabs are named by index: `tab0`, `tab1`, `tab3` ... etc.

#### toggleRender

Should you also want to customise the HTML that is rendered inside the tab toggle elements,
you can pass a render function into this prop. This will then override the default HTML inside
the toggles.

```
<Tabs.Tab
    title="Panel 1"
    name="myTab"
    toggleRender={
    ({isActive, name, title}) =>
        isActive ?
            <b>{title}</b> :
            <span className={name}>{title}</b>
    JSON.stringify(props)
    }>
    <p>You are on panel 1.</p>
</Tabs.Tab>
```

The render function is called with:

##### title

The text title of the tab so that you can render that text into your own JSX.

##### name

The name given to the tab in question. This can be handy in some cases where generic render
functions are used.

##### isActive

A boolean value indicating if the tab is currently active.
