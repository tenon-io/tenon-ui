## Smart form components

The set of `Tenon-UI smart form components` strives to make data management, validation and 
accessibility a very manageable task in React applications.

Used together these components will:

1. Automatically manage the data entered in the form and expose that to you through submit events.
1. Provide you with an easy to manage hierarchical validation engine that allows you to easily add
your own validators and error messages.
1. Provide you with everything you need to ensure that each form and form field is accessible.
