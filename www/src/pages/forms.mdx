## Smart form components

The set of `Tenon-UI smart form components` strives to make data management, validation and 
accessibility a very manageable task in React applications.

Used together these components will:

1. Automatically manage the data entered in the form and expose that to you through submit events.
1. Provide you with an easy to manage hierarchical validation engine that allows you to easily add
your own validators and error messages.
1. Provide you with everything you need to ensure that each form and form field is accessible.


Follow these steps to create powerful, accessible forms with `Tenon-ui`:

1. If the terms `render props` and `prop getters` are not yet clear, visit the [Reguired knowledge page](/forms-knowledge).
1. Learn how to [replace your form elements](/forms-form-component) with the `Form component`. 
1. [Learn about our smart controllers](/forms-smart-controllers) and how they provide data, validation and 
accessibility management. 
1. Then learn how to create form elements with `Tenon-UI` by [using the view components](/forms-view-components).

## Want to create your own view?

Every view component on the `Tenon-UI` smart form is completely replaceable.
 
If you want to create your own view simply make direct use of the `prop getter` functions 
as well as other props provided by the `smart controllers`.

You can create views for:

1. [Input fields](/forms-create-your-own-input-view)
1. [Textareas](/forms-create-your-own-textarea-view)
1. [Select dropdowns](/forms-create-your-own-select-view)
1. [Single checkboxes](/forms-create-your-own-checkbox-view)

### Disclaimer
The `smart controllers` provide all the function to create fully accessible form controls, however,
this needs to be backed up with an accessible HTML view. We can therefore not guarantee that
every view rendered with `Tenon-UI` will be accessible unless the supplied view components are
used or mimicked exactly in terms of HTML function.
 
Feel free to mix up the HTML but ensure that all elements are present and that the prop getters are 
applied correctly.
 
And be sure to test with screen readers.
