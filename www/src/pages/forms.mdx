## Smart form components

The set of `Tenon-UI smart form components` strives to make data management, validation and 
accessibility a very manageable task in React applications.

Used together these components will:

1. Automatically manage the data entered in the form and expose that to you through submit events.
1. Provide you with an easy to manage hierarchical validation engine that allows you to easily add
your own validators and error messages.
1. Provide you with everything you need to ensure that each form and form field is accessible.


Follow these steps to create powerful, accessible forms with `Tenon-ui`:

1. If the terms `render props` and `prop getters` are not yet clear, visit the [Reguired knowledge page](/forms-knowledge).
1. Learn how to [replace your form elements](/forms-form-component) with the `Form component`. 
1. [Learn about our smart controllers](/forms-smart-controllers) and how they provide data, validation and 
accessibility management. 

Now you can start creating smart form elements. See how you can do this by visiting the page
of the element you want to create.

1. [Text input](/forms-text-input)
