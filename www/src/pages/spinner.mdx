## Spinner

Visual aids can be very helpful in an application but for people who cannot see them they can
sometimes seriously degrade the overall experience of the web application if these aids carry
important information.

An often used aid in JavaScript application is the busy spinner.

`Tenon-UI` gives you an `Spinner` component you can use overall. This component already has
accessibility built in.

### Usage

The spinner can be imported and used as a normal component:

```
import { Spinner } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

//...

<Spinner
    title="Busy fetching data"
    className="demo-spinner"
/>
```

The `Spinner` can easily be styled and sized:

```
.demo-spinner {
    color: black;
    width: 5em;
}
```

This will display as:

<Spinner title="Busy fetching data" className="demo-spinner" />

### Component props

#### title

This is required.

A string value describing the spinner. Please use this to describe the purpose of the spinner,
such as "Busy fetching user data.".

Without a proper title, such spinners are inaccessible to a large number of people.

#### className

You can use this to give a class to the internal `SVG` so that you can style it with `CSS`
as shown above.
