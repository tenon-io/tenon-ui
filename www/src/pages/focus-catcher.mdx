## Focus catcher

Usually the `React event system` fully respects and follows the way events work in the actual
`browser DOM`.

But with `focus` and `blur` this is different. In React, both of these events are bubbled up the
three until they are handled. This is a conscious decision, and even makes it possible to 
[sanely implement alternatives for Focus Outside](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#mouse-and-pointer-events).

In accessible applications I want to keep the CSS focus outline intact for all elements that can
receive focus. But here this bubbling can cause some unexpected side effects. 

The input below sits in a focusable container. A `div` that has been given `tabIndex="-1"` because
we may want to set focus to it later via code. Click on the label below to see the side effect:

<div className="form-group" tabIndex="-1">
    <div className="field-wrapper">
        <label for="focusFailId">Click for focus side effect</label>
        <input type="text" id="focusFailId" />
    </div>
</div>

These kind of side effects could temp you to remove the focus outline from elements that should
actually have this.

This is where the `FocusCatcher` component can help you.

### Usage

Simply wrap clickable content in the `FocusCatcher` component and it will act as a boundary
that catches and handles the bubbled `focus event`:

```
import { FocusCatcher } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

//...

<section tabIndex="-1">

//...

    <FocusCatcher>
        <label htmlFor="myId">Click me</label>
        <input type="text" id="myId" />
    </FocusCatcher>

//...

</section>
```

Here is the same example as above, but with the `FocusCatcher` component introduced:

<div className="form-group" tabIndex="-1">
    <FocusCatcher>
        <div className="field-wrapper">
            <label htmlFor="focusTrapId">Click for normal focus effect</label>
            <input type="text" id="focusTrapId" />
        </div>
    </FocusCatcher>
</div>
