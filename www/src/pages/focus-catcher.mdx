## Focus catcher

Usually the `React event system` fully respects and follows the way events work in the actual
`browser DOM`.

But with `focus` and `blur` this is different. In React, both of these events are bubbled up the
tree until they are handled. This is a conscious decision, and even makes it possible to
[sanely implement alternatives for Focus Outside](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#mouse-and-pointer-events).

In accessible applications you want to keep the CSS focus outline intact for all elements that can
receive focus. But here this bubbling can cause some unexpected side effects.

The input below sits in a focusable container: a `div` that has been given `tabIndex="-1"` because
we may want to set focus to it later via code. Click on the label below to see the side effect:

<div className="form-group" tabIndex="-1">
    <div className="field-wrapper">
        <label for="focusFailId">Click for focus side effect</label>
        <input type="text" id="focusFailId" />
    </div>
</div>

These kind of side effects could tempt you to remove the focus outline from elements that should
actually have this.

This is where the `FocusCatcher` component can help you.

### Usage

Simply wrap clickable content in the `FocusCatcher` component and it will act as a boundary
that catches and handles the bubbled `focus event`:

```
import { FocusCatcher } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

//...

<section tabIndex="-1">

//...

    <FocusCatcher>
        <label htmlFor="myId">Click me</label>
        <input type="text" id="myId" />
    </FocusCatcher>

//...

</section>
```

Here is the same example as above, but with the `FocusCatcher` component introduced:

<div className="form-group" tabIndex="-1">
    <FocusCatcher>
        <div className="field-wrapper">
            <label htmlFor="focusTrapId">Click for normal focus effect</label>
            <input type="text" id="focusTrapId" />
        </div>
    </FocusCatcher>
</div>
