## Styling

At `Tenon.io` we like to use `CSS` as it was intended. This is our choice and not a criticism of
other methods of styling, such as `CSS modules`.

Currently `Tenon-UI` comes with a compiled `style sheet` as well as `SASS` source files for you 
to use. 

You use our compiled `CSS`, import and override our `SASS` files, or completely restyle the components
using the classes rendered on the elements.

Our styles are based on [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/) to be as lightweight
and non-intrusive as possible.

### The compiled stylesheet

In your React app, simply import the `tenon-ui.css` file located in the `/lib/styles` part of 
the import:

```
import '@tenon-io/tenon-ui/lib/styles/tenon-ui.css';
```

### SASS files

If your build configuration supports `SASS` compilation, you can also simply import the main `SASS`
file:

```
import '@tenon-io/tenon-ui/lib/styles/tenon-ui.scss';
```

But you also have access to the source files. The main file shows the standard dependencies:

```css
$color-button-primary: #004aa9;
$color-button-secondary: #575757;
$color-negative: darken(#c7162b, 15%);
$color-caution: #ffa500;

@import 'vanilla-framework/scss/vanilla';

@include vf-base;
@include vf-p-forms;
@include vf-p-buttons;

@import 'tenon_forms';
@import 'tenon_buttons';
@import 'tenon_notifications';
@import 'tenon_tabs';
@import 'tenon_spinner_buttons';
@import 'tenon_helpers.scss';
@import 'tenon_resets';
```

Please note the dependency on `Vanilla Framework`. Also note that in order for your compilation
to succeed `node_modules` **MUST** be registered as a path with the `SASS` compiler.

If you want to override our styles, you can use this file as example. Then you can override or change
any of the components to achieve the look your desire.

The colours you can override is shown in the [Vanilla Framework Color documentation](https://docs.vanillaframework.io/en/settings/color-settings).

### Roll your own solution

If you would like a totally different visual experience and cannot do this with the files provided,
you can of course create your own style sheet.

Please refer to the source files and rendered HTML to see how.

Just remember that clear colour combinations and contrasts are also important for accessibility.
If you use our styles, you get that out of the box.

### But what about stuff like CSS Modules and Styled Components?

`Tenon-UI` was built by Tenon for Tenon so we did it with our preference in mind.

But if you want to use `Tenon-UI` or you are already using it but you want to used other methods of styling,
please open a Pull Request to discuss. We are open to the discussion and moving `Tenon-UI` towards
a library that YOU can use easily, but we will need your help sometimes to get it there.
