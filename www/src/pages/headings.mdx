import Helmet from 'react-helmet';

import Layout from '../components/Layout';

export default ({ children }) => (
    <Layout>
        <Helmet>
            <title>Tenon-ui | Headings</title>
        </Helmet>
        {children}
    </Layout>
);

## Headings

The hierarchy of headings is very important. Heading elements (`<h1> - <h6>`) are not there to provide
different styles. They are there to provide structure to your application.

Headings are to be used in order and levels should not be skipped.

Every page should start with an `<h1>` with subsequent headings being applied in order.

Example HTML:

```html
<h1>Main heading</h1>
<section>
    <h2>Section heading 1</h2>

    <h3>Section sub heading 1</h3>
    <h3>Section sub heading 2</h3>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Section heading 2</h2>

    <h3>Section sub heading 1</h3>
    <h3>Section sub heading 2</h3>
</section>
```

This can seem simple enough until we use it in a complex React application. Because
of component composition and re-use it can be hard to anticipate which `<h>` element
to use.

### The Heading component

The `Tenon-UI` heading component handles automatic calculation of heading levels for you.

The component is composite and contains to sub components:

#### Heading.H

This component replace the standard `<h>` elements, but it used in exactly the same way:

```
<Heading.H>
    My heading text
</Heading.H>
```

If used by itself, it will always render an `<h1>` element.

#### Heading.LevelBoundary

To allow automatic level calculation, use the `Heading.LevelBoundary` component.

This component is applied every time a new level should be used in the wrapped code:

```
<Heading.H>I will be an h1</Heading.H>
<Heading.LevelBoundary>
    <Heading.H>
        I will be an h2
    </Heading.H>
    <Heading.LevelBoundary>
        <Heading.H>
            I will be an h3
        </Heading.H>
    </Heading.LevelBoundary>
    <Heading.H>
        I will be an h2
    </Heading.H>
</Heading.LevelBoundary>
```

Here the levels are all shown together, for clarity, but usually these levels will extend across
components. If used throughout your component codebase, the levels will always calculate correctly
and should you refactor the code, the levels will auto adjust.

The `Heading.LevelBoundary` component will, when first applied, cause the next `Heading.H` to render
as an `h2`.

If you want change this, you can use the `levelOverride` prop:

```
<Heading.LevelBoundary levelOverride={3}>
    <Heading.H>
        I will be an h3
    </Heading.H>
    <Heading.LevelBoundary>
        <Heading.H>
            I will be an h4
        </Heading.H>
    </Heading.LevelBoundary>
    <Heading.H>
        I will be an h3
    </Heading.H>
</Heading.LevelBoundary>
```

This allows for fine tuning the heading level, should the defaults not be enough or if you
are using it in a section of an application not fully driven by this component.

### Component using Header

Some of the Tenon-UI components use the `Heading` component internally to allow you to integrate
their headings seamlessly into your application. These are:

1. [The ErrorBlock](/forms-error-block)
1. [The Tabbed Interface](/tabs)
