import Helmet from 'react-helmet';

import Layout from '../components/Layout';
import Disclosure from '../../../src/modules/layout/disclosure/Disclosure';

export default ({ children }) => (
    <Layout>
        <Helmet>

        {children}

## Disclosure

We often need to hide verbose bits of the user interface and allow the user to expand and
collapse these elements. This creates a better user experience and for this we need
a `Disclosure` widget.

If you would like to get into the nuts and bolts of such a control, read the
[Collapsible Sections article on the Inclusive Components site](https://inclusive-components.design/collapsible-sections/).

The important part to know is that the button triggering the region should have
`aria-expanded` set to the expanded state of the region.

### Usage

We wanted to make this control as easy and as flexible as possible to use. In its simplest
form the control is used as follows:

```
<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>Expand/collapse</Disclosure.Trigger>
    <Disclosure.Target>
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
            elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
            dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
            nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip
            ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
            reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore
            eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat
            cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia
            deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
        </p>
    </Disclosure.Target>
</Disclosure>
```

This renders:

<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>Expand/collapse</Disclosure.Trigger>
    <Disclosure.Target>
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim
            ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
            aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
            reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
            pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in
            culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
        </p>
    </Disclosure.Target>
</Disclosure>

Note that there is a `Disclosure` component that wraps the entire section of `JSX` you
would like to control with the trigger.

Then you have a `Disclosure.Trigger` component that always renders a button and will control
the targets specified on the same level as the trigger.

Finally you have a `Disclosure.Target` component that can take any type of `JSX` content,
and this will be the content that gets hidden and shown when the trigger is toggled.

### Disclosure component

This component manages the region of JSX managed by the `Trigger`. Any `Target` components
inside this region will be acted upon by the `Trigger`.

#### Rules

-   Only ever add one `Trigger` component to any `Disclosure` component. As you will see below
    the disclosures can be nested but always have another `Disclosure` level before adding another
    `Trigger`.

-   Always precede any `Target` components with a `Trigger`. Do **NOT** render a `Trigger`
    after a `Target` it controls as this will confuse users.

#### Props

##### isExpanded

This boolean prop is used to override the internal open / closed toggle stage of the
`Disclosure`.

It can be used to render the component as default open on mount.

Or it can be used to open / close the `Disclosure` from outside. This is particularly
handy if you have a number of expandable regions and you want to create an
`Expand all` or `Collapse all` button.

**Note**: Expanding and collapsing many regions with this is up to you to implement
correctly with a boolean flag. If your button is not directly above the regions you
are expanding or collapsing, please make sure you notify the users that something has
happened by making use of [ARIA Live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions).

### The trigger

The `Trigger` sub component will always render a `<button type="button">`. This is the
recommended element type to use.

#### Trigger props

##### expandedClass

This string prop accepts a class string to add to the `class` attribute of the button in
the DOM when its controlled element is expanded. It will be merged with all other
CSS classes added and allows styling the button based on the toggle state.

##### other

The `Trigger` accept all standard props that the `<button>` JSX element accepts.

#### Render content based on toggle state

Should you want to change the content of the `<button>` element, based on the toggle state,
the `Trigger` component also accept a `children render prop` that is called with the current
toggle state:

```
<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>
        {expanded => expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    <Disclosure.Target>
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
            elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
            dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
            nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip
            ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
            reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore
            eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat
            cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia
            deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
        </p>
    </Disclosure.Target>
</Disclosure>
```

You can see it working here:

<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>
        {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand')}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    <Disclosure.Target>
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim
            ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
            aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
            reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
            pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in
            culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
        </p>
    </Disclosure.Target>
</Disclosure>

### The target

The `Target` sub component houses the content you would like to expand and collapse.

Please note that you can add multiple targets inside one `Disclosure` component. All
the targets will then be operated on by their nearest sibling `Trigger`. For example:

```
<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>
        {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand')}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    <Disclosure.Target>
        <p>
          First target.
        </p>
    </Disclosure.Target>
    <Disclosure.Target>
        <p>
            Second target.
        </p>
    </Disclosure.Target>
</Disclosure>
```

Which gives:

<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>
        {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand')}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    <Disclosure.Target>
        <p>First target.</p>
    </Disclosure.Target>
    <Disclosure.Target>
        <p>Second target.</p>
    </Disclosure.Target>
</Disclosure>

This allows easy management of the content without extraneous wrapping tags. It also
helps if you want to map elements into the target.

**NOTE**: It is very important that the `Trigger` **PRECEDES** the `Target` components
it controls. If you place the target before the trigger you will need to do more work
to make it properly functional for keyboard and screen reader users. We recommend always
placing your `Trigger` first. We further recommend placing the `Trigger` as close to the
`Target` in the resulting DOM as possible.

#### Target props

#### useHidden

By default the `Disclosure` component will add and remove the desired content from
the DOM. This is the most performant option.

However, if you want to animate the collapse / expand action or would rather have the
content in memory and hidden with CSS you can set this boolean prop to `true`.

The content will then receive the `hidden` attribute instead.

This is, of course, how you could preserve the state of the content, as removing the content out
of the DOM would lose any internal component state for that part of the component
tree.

#### deactivate

This boolean prop is an escape hatch out of the default behaviour. In some cases you
may want to keep a specific target from hiding and showing. For example, where you
map elements into the `Target` component and always want the first element shown.

This reduces the amount of code you need to write to achieve this. Normally you would
duplicate a section of JSX but with this prop you can simply do this:

```
<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>
        {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand')}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    {targets.map((target, i) =>
        <Disclosure.Target deactivate={i === 0}>
           <p>
             {target.text}
           </p>
        </Disclosure.Target>)}
</Disclosure>
```

### Nesting

You are able to nest `Disclosure` components. The `Target` will always be controlled by its
nearest sibling `Trigger`:

```
<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>
        {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand')}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    <Disclosure.Target useHidden="true">
        <p>Parent target.</p>
        <Disclosure>
            <Disclosure.Trigger>
                {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse nested' : 'Expand nested')}
            </Disclosure.Trigger>
            <Disclosure.Target useHidden="true">
                <p>Nested target.</p>
            </Disclosure.Target>
        </Disclosure>
    </Disclosure.Target>
</Disclosure>re.Target>
</Disclosure>
```

<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger>
        {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand')}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    <Disclosure.Target useHidden="true">
        <p>Parent target.</p>
        <Disclosure>
            <Disclosure.Trigger>
                {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse nested' : 'Expand nested')}
            </Disclosure.Trigger>
            <Disclosure.Target useHidden="true">
                <p>Nested target.</p>
            </Disclosure.Target>
        </Disclosure>
    </Disclosure.Target>
</Disclosure>

**Note**: Here we used the `useHidden` prop to conserve the state of the nested
`Disclosure` widget.

### What about aria-controls

If you know ARIA, you may ask why this widget does not automatically implement
`aria-controls`?

Well, this ARIA state is particularly badly implemented in screen readers, as you
can read in [this article by Heydon Pickering](http://www.heydonworks.com/article/aria-controls-is-poop).

We have therefore decided to forgo this until there is better support for it as it would
lead to a more complex component.

If, however, you want to implement `aria-controls` yourself, it can very easily be done:

```
<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger aria-controls="my-target">
        {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand')}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    <div id="my-target">
        <Disclosure.Target>
            <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
                elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
                dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
                nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip
                ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
                reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore
                eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat
                cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia
                deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
            </p>
        </Disclosure.Target>
    </div>
</Disclosure>
```

If you check out the rendered DOM of this example, you will see that
`aria-controls` is now rendered properly.

<Disclosure>
    <Disclosure.Trigger aria-controls="my-target">
        {expanded => (expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand')}
    </Disclosure.Trigger>
    <div id="my-target">
        <Disclosure.Target>
            <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
                eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
                enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
                nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor
                in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat
                nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident,
                sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
            </p>
        </Disclosure.Target>
    </div>
</Disclosure>
