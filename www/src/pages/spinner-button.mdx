## Spinner button

When you want to trigger an asynchronous action with a button and clearly indicate to all users that
the action is busy and also that it has completed, you can use `Tenon-IU`'s `SpinnerButton`. 

It shows a visual spinner while marked as active and also broadcasts the necessary messages to screen 
readers.

### Usage

The spinner button is used as follows:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { SpinnerButton } from '@tenon-ui/tenon-ui';

class SpinnerButtonExample extends Component {
    state = {
        showSpinner: false
    };

    onClickHandler = () => {
        this.setState({ showSpinner: true });
        someAsynAction().then(() => {
            this.setState({ showSpinner: false });
        })
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <SpinnerButton
                className="primary spinner-button"
                onClick={this.onClickHandler}
                onBusyClick={() => {
                    alert('The button is still busy.');
                }}
                busyText="Async action is busy."
                completeText="Async action is complete."
                isBusy={this.state.showSpinner}
            >
                Click me
            </SpinnerButton>
        );
    }
}

export default SpinnerButtonExample;
```

Which gives you:

<SpinnerButtonExample />

Try clicking this button. Also click the button while it is busy spinning.

Also test this button with a screen reader!

### SpinnerButton component props

#### onClick

The same `onClick` handler you would use with a normal `button`.

It is important to note that this event handler is only fired if the button is in a non-busy
state, to avoid multiple clicks of the button. `Tenon-UI` does **NOT** recommend using a `disabled`
state on a button at any time as these buttons cannot easily be found and recognised by all users.

Therefore the button remains clickable but the `SpinnerButton` component manages for you whether the
`onClick` handler is executed or not.

#### isBusy
This prop is required.

A boolean value indicating if the action triggered by the button is busy. You are responsible 
for linking this to your asynchronous action in the code.

#### busyText 
A string value that will be broadcast to screen readers when the button is busy.

#### completeText
A string value that will be broadcast to screen readers when the button action completes.

#### onBusyClick
An event handler that always fires.

You may want trigger an action if a user clicks on a button with a busy state. This allows you 
to set notifications or other side effects of clicking on a busy button. You can use the 
`onBusyClick` handler for that purpose as the `onClick` handler is only executed when the button is 
in a non-busy state.

#### spinnerImgSrc
An imported animated image source.

If you do not like the spinner that `Tenon-UI` renders, you can provide your own by using this prop.

```
//...

import mySpinnerImage from './mySpinnerImage.svg';

//...

<SpinnerButton
    className="primary spinner-button"
    onClick={this.onClickHandler}
    onBusyClick={() => {
        alert('The button is still busy.');
    }}
    busyText="Async action is busy."
    completeText="Async action is complete."
    isBusy={this.state.showSpinner}
    spinnerImgSrc={mySpinnerImage}
>
    Click me
</SpinnerButton>

```
