## Notifications

In order for application notifications to benefit all users they need to support screen readers
so that user who rely on these can know when something has happened in your application.

The `Tenon-UI Notification` component is a lightweight wrapper that manages this for you while you
still have complete freedom to develop the notification view that you want.

```
import React, { Component, Fragment } from 'react';
import { Notification } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

class NotificationExample extends Component {
    state = {
        showInfoMessage: false
    };

    onClickHandler = () => {
        this.setState({ showInfoMessage: true });
    };

    onDismissHandler = () => {
        this.setState({ showInfoMessage: false });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <Fragment>
                <Notification isActive={this.state.showInfoMessage} type="info">
                    <span>This is an information message</span>
                    <button
                        type="button"
                        className="dismiss-button"
                        onClick={this.onDismissHandler}
                    >
                        Dismiss
                    </button>
                </Notification>
                <button onClick={this.onClickHandler}>
                    Show information message
                </button>
            </Fragment>
        );
    }
}

export default NotificationExample;
```

The component manages when the content is shown and thereby will notify screen reader users
that something has happened.

Working example of an information notification:

<NotificationExample />

Note that the `Notification` component is really just a helper container that helps you
ensure that screen readers can also work well with your notifications. Most of the implementation
is up to you.

### Notification component props

#### isActive
This prop is required.

A boolean prop indicating if the content of the `Notification` component should be shown or
hidden. 

#### type
This prop is required.

A string prop indicating what type of notification you want to render:

1. **error**
2. **warning**
3. **success**
4. **info**

Changing this setting will ensure that screen readers read the message at the correct priority
setting as well as decorate the container with a class equal to the type so that you can
hit it with styling.
