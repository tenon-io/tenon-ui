## Notifications

In order for application notifications to benefit all users they need to support screen readers
so that users know when something has happened in your application.

The `Tenon-UI Notification` component is a lightweight wrapper that manages this for you while you
still have complete freedom to develop the notification view that you want.

```
import React, { Component, Fragment } from 'react';
import { Notification } from '@tenon-io/tenon-ui';

class NotificationExample extends Component {
    state = {
        showInfoMessage: false
    };

    onClickHandler = () => {
        this.setState({ showInfoMessage: true });
    };

    onDismissHandler = () => {
        this.setState({ showInfoMessage: false });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <Fragment>
                <Notification isActive={this.state.showInfoMessage} type="info">
                    <span>This is an information message</span>
                    <button
                        type="button"
                        className="dismiss-button"
                        onClick={this.onDismissHandler}
                    >
                        Dismiss
                    </button>
                </Notification>
                <button onClick={this.onClickHandler}>
                    Show information message
                </button>
            </Fragment>
        );
    }
}

export default NotificationExample;
```

The component manages when the content is shown and thereby will notify screen reader users
that something has happened.

Working example of an information notification:

<NotificationExample />

Note that the `Notification` component is really just a helper container that helps you
ensure that screen readers can also work well with your notifications. Most of the implementation
is up to you.

### Notification component props

#### isActive

This prop is required.

A boolean prop indicating if the content of the `Notification` component should be shown or
hidden.

#### type

This prop is required.

A string prop indicating what type of notification you want to render:

1. **error**
2. **warning**
3. **success**
4. **info**

Changing this setting will ensure that screen readers read the message at the correct priority
setting as well as decorates the container with a class equal to the type so that you can
hit it with styling.
